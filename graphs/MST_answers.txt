1. Three essential properties of a MST:

    a. It is a tree.
        - it does not contain any cycles.

    b. It spans the graph.
        - it contains all of the graph's nodes and is a subset of the graph.

    c. It is the spanning tree with the minimal weight.
        - the sum of the weights of all edges in the tree is the minimum one. 

2. We should pick the node/edge connected to the first node that has an edge with the minimum weight. This ensures that the tree we built so far is minimum.

3. We should continue picking nodes/edges (that have not been picked) connected to the tree with the minimum edge weight. This ensures that we do not create a cycle and that the edge weights are the least possible. We are finished when all of the nodes are in the tree because the tree would be a minimal spanning tree. 

4. At each step, we should pick the edge that has the minimum weight and that does not create a cycle. This ensures that we have built a minimal tree so far because all of the edges are the least possible. We are finished when N-1 edges have been picked because this is the number of edges in a tree given N nodes.
