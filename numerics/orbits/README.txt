The forward Euler's method produced a system with increasing energy, hence the average
orbital distance increased over time.

The backward Euler's method produced a system with decreasing energy, hence the average 
orbital distance decreased over time.

The symplectic Euler's method produced a system with a largely constant energy and
average orbital distance, most accurately simulating an object in a bound orbit.
